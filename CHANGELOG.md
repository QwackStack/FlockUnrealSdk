## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Global SDK accessor + auto-init.** `UFlockSubsystem` (a `UGameInstanceSubsystem`) is created when the game starts and is the entry point to the SDK — the Unreal analog of the Unity SDK's `FlockClient`. Fetch it with `UFlockSubsystem::Get(WorldContext)` or `GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem<UFlockSubsystem>()` (C++ and Blueprint). With **Auto-Initialize On Load** on (default), it initializes from **Project Settings → Flock SDK** at startup; otherwise call `InitializeFromSettings()` or `InitializeWithConfig()` yourself. `IsInitialized()`, `GetInitializationError()`, and the `OnFlockInitialized` / `OnFlockInitializationFailed` Blueprint events expose init state. Init is fail-safe — a bad config or unresolved version leaves the SDK uninitialized and logs the reason instead of crashing startup.
- **Synchronous, offline init with a baked Game Version ID.** Init makes no network call: the Game Version ID is resolved at edit time and baked into `DefaultGame.ini`, then consumed directly at runtime. Init fails cleanly when the ID is unresolved. `UFlockSubsystem::ApiVersion` (`v1`) and `GetVersionedApiUrl()` are the single source of truth for the API version segment (mirrors the Unity SDK — bump both for parity).
- **`FFlockInitConfig` + `UFlockConfig::IsValid`.** A runtime init struct built from project settings via `FromSettings()`, and a config-completeness check (API URL / API Key / Game Name / Game Version) shared by runtime auto-init and the editor guards.
- **Editor version baking (`FlockEditor` module).** **Tools → Flock → Resolve Game Version** resolves the Game Version name to its ID and bakes it into `DefaultGame.ini`. A notification-first Play-In-Editor setup guard warns when the SDK can't initialize, and a Data Validation build guard blocks packaging on an unresolved ID (toggle via **Fail Build If Version Unresolved**).
- **Pluggable logger.** `IFlockLogger`, with `FFlockUnrealLogger` (routes to the `LogFlock` category with a `[Flock SDK]` prefix) and `FFlockNullLogger` (silent) — inject your own via `UFlockSubsystem::SetLogger()` to feed an on-screen debugger or telemetry. Mirrors the Unity SDK's `IFlockLogger`. **Enable Debug Logs** turns on verbose Debug/Info; warnings and errors always surface.
- **`Flock.SelfTest` console command** (development builds) — drives the boot/init surface and narrates each step to the log, so you can watch the flow without a backend or a baked version.
- **Automation tests**, co-located per feature and grouped under the `Flock.` prefix (run from Session Frontend → Automation): config validation, init-config mapping, subsystem init/gate/shutdown, logger routing and the null logger, version-resolver URL construction and bake, the build-guard decision, and the version-lookup stub and registry.

### Known limitations
- **Network transport is stubbed.** The edit-time version lookup sits behind `IFlockVersionLookup`; its default `FFlockStubVersionLookup` fails cleanly until the HTTP layer ships and registers a real lookup via `FFlockVersionLookupRegistry`. Until then, **Resolve Game Version** cannot resolve, and the build guard stays inert (it will not block a package) — so the SDK cannot complete a real init yet. Everything else (accessor, auto-init, gate, guards, logger) is live-wired around the stub.
- **Feature providers absent.** Authentication, config, player data, shop, analytics, and the error model are not present in this release — they build on this foundation.
